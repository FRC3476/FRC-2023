# Training 11/26

Oh no! Some malicious people have made some commits and now we don't have buttons assigned for our robot anymore!

[Here](./src/main/java/frc/robot/Robot.java) is all we have left... it is now up to you to reassign the buttons. 
We will be running your code and testing your buttons.

These classes will be helpful.
